This section lists software packages and sites which may be useful for people working with the AVR.

<h2><a href="https://macromates.com/" target="_blank">TextMate</a></h2>
This is a text editor. We list it here because it's a powerful programming editor and it's free. If you don't want to install Xcode, you probably want TextMate for source code editing.

<h2><a href="http://www.engbedded.com/fusecalc/" target="_blank">AVR Fuse Calculator</a></h2>
This web site is an interactive fuse value calculator for AVR devices. You choose the desired options from pop-up menus or checkboxes and it tells you the hexadecimal fuse values to be used with AVRDUDE.

<h2><a href="http://vonnieda.org/software/avrfuses/" target="_blank">AVRFuses</a></h2>
This native Mac application is a GUI frontend for AVRDUDE, the uploader/downloader tool which ships with <?echo $pkgname?>. AVRFuses, as the name suggests, contains a fuse value calculator for user friendly feature selection. AVRFuses is free!

<h2><a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/" target="_blank">V-USB</a></h2>
Objective Development has a USB library for AVR microcontrollers. This library implements low speed USB device functionality without special hardware resources. Only one edge triggered interrupt is required. This library is free (Gnu General Public License version 2 and 3).

<h2><a href="http://www.atmel.com/Microsite/atmel-studio/" target="_blank">Atmel Studio</a></h2>
This is Atmel's development environment for AVRs running on Windows. It ships with avr-gcc for C/C++ development. <?echo $pkgname?> tracks the development of AVR Studio and tries to provide the same functionality.
